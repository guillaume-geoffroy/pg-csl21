In this paper, we show that fixed point theorems on partial metric spaces (including the Matthews fixed point theorem) can be deduced from fixed point theorems on metric spaces. New fixed point theorems on metric spaces are established and analogous results on partial metric spaces are deduced.},

@article{VANBREUGEL20011,
	Abstract = {Our focus is on the semantics of programming and specification languages. Over the years, different approaches to give semantics to these languages have been put forward. We restrict ourselves to the operational and the denotational approach, two main streams in the field of semantics. Two notions which play an important role in this paper are (non)determinism and (non)termination. Nondeterminism arises naturally in concurrent languages and it is a key concept in specification languages. Nontermination is usually caused by recursive constructs which are crucial in programming. The operational models are based on labelled transition systems. The definition of these systems is guided by the structure of the language. Metric spaces are an essential ingredient of our denotational models. We exploit the metric structure to model recursive constructs and to define operators on infinite entities. Furthermore, we also employ the metric structure to relate operational and denotational models for a given language. On the basis of four toy languages, we develop some general theory for defining operational and denotational semantic models and for relating them. This theory is applicable to a wide variety of languages. We start with a very simple deterministic and terminating imperative programming language. By adding the recursive while statement, we obtain a deterministic and nonterminating language. Next, we augment the language with the parallel composition resulting in a bounded nondeterministic and nonterminating language. Finally, we add some timed constructs. We obtain an unbounded nondeterministic and nonterminating specification language.},

@article{BRAUN200975,
	Abstract = {Recent research in quantitative theories for information-hiding topics, such as Anonymity and Secure Information Flow, tend to converge towards the idea of modeling the system as a noisy channel in the information-theoretic sense. The notion of information leakage, or vulnerability of the system, has been related in some approaches to the concept of mutual information of the channel. A recent work of Smith has shown, however, that if the attack consists in one single try, then the mutual information and other concepts based on Shannon entropy are not suitable, and he has proposed to use R{\'e}nyi's min-entropy instead. In this paper, we consider and compare two different possibilities of defining the leakage, based on the Bayes risk, a concept related to R{\'e}nyi min-entropy.},

	Abstract = {The quantale of distance distributions is of fundamental importance for understanding probabilistic metric spaces as enriched categories. Motivated by the categorical interpretation of partial metric spaces, we are led to investigate the quantaloid of diagonals between distance distributions, which is expected to establish the categorical foundation of probabilistic partial metric spaces. Observing that the quantale of distance distributions w.r.t. an arbitrary continuous t-norm is non-divisible, we precisely characterize diagonals between distance distributions, and prove that one-step functions are the only distance distributions on which the set of diagonals coincides with the generated down set.},

For this model, under suitable complexity assumptions, it is proved that extracting any information about the cleartext from the cyphertext is hard on the average for an adversary with polynomially bounded computational resources. The proof holds for any message space with any probability distribution. The first implementation of this model is presented. The security of this implementation is proved under the interactability assumptin of deciding Quadratic Residuosity modulo composite numbers whose factorization is unknown.},

One of these interprets programs as partial measurable functions on a measurable space. The other interprets programs as continuous linear operators on a Banach space of measures. It is shown how the ordered domains of Scott and others are embedded naturally into these spaces. We use the semantics to prove a general result about probabilistic programs, namely, that a program's behavior is completely determined by its action on fixed inputs.},

	Abstract = {In any setting in which observable properties have a quantitative flavor, it is natural to compare computational objects by way of metrics rather than equivalences or partial orders. This holds, in particular, for probabilistic higher-order programs. A natural notion of comparison, then, becomes context distance, the metric analogue of Morris' context equivalence. In this paper, we analyze the main properties of the context distance in fully-fledged probabilistic {\$}{\$}{\backslash}lambda {\$}{\$}-calculi, this way going beyond the state of the art, in which only affine calculi were considered. We first of all study to which extent the context distance trivializes, giving a sufficient condition for trivialization. We then characterize context distance by way of a coinductively-defined, tuple-based notion of distance in one of those calculi, called {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varLambda ^{\backslash}oplus {\_}!{\$}{\$}. We finally derive pseudometrics for call-by-name and call-by-value probabilistic {\$}{\$}{\backslash}lambda {\$}{\$}-calculi, and prove them fully-abstract.},

	Abstract = {The bisimilarity pseudometric based on the Kantorovich lifting is one of the most popular metrics for probabilistic processes proposed in the literature. However, its application in verification is limited to linear properties. We propose a generalization of this metric which allows to deal with a wider class of properties, such as those used in security and privacy. More precisely, we propose a family of metrics, parametrized on a notion of distance which depends on the property we want to verify. Furthermore, we show that the members of this family still characterize bisimilarity in terms of their kernel, and provide a bound on the corresponding metrics on traces. Finally, we study the case of a metric corresponding to differential privacy. We show that in this case it is possible to have a dual form, easier to compute, and we prove that the typical constructs of process algebra are non-expansive with respect to this metrics, thus paving the way to a modular approach to verification.},

	Abstract = {The notion of process equivalence of probabilistic processes is sensitive to the exact probabilities of transitions. Thus, a slight change in the transition probabilities will result in two equivalent processes being deemed no longer equivalent. This instability is due to the quantitative nature of probabilistic processes. In a situation where the process behavior has a quantitative aspect there should be a more robust approach to process equivalence. This paper studies a metric between labelled Markov processes. This metric has the property that processes are at zero distance if and only if they are bisimilar. The metric is inspired by earlier work on logics for characterizing bisimulation and is related, in spirit, to the Hutchinson metric.},

In the metric case the existence and uniqueness of a meaning function can be established under some reasonable assumptions. In the cpo-case we obtain the existence of a least meaning function.
