Partial metric spaces were introduced as a variant of metric spaces in which self-distances can be non-zero. Extensive litterature exists onthem \cite{bkmp:partial-metrics, doi:10.1111/j.1749-6632.1994.tb44144.x, Samet:2013aa}), and they are related to standard metric spaces and their topology in a very strong way: any partial metric generates a standard metric and many fundamental concepts and results on metric topology (\textit{e.g.} Cauchy sequences, completeness, Banach-fixed point theorem) scale well to partial metric spaces \cite{bkmp:partial-metrics, doi:10.1111/j.1749-6632.1994.tb44144.x}.
\emph{Generalized partial metric spaces}, \textit{i.e.} partial metric spaces over an arbitrary quantale, are well-investigated too \cite{AGT2000,AGT7849}: we quickly recall their definition, along with that of a commutative integral quantale (which is the only kind of quantale we will consider here), as we will use these concepts throughout this paper.

\begin{definition} A \emph{commutative integral quantale} is a triple $(Q, \quantaleop, \quantaleleq)$ where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $(Q, \quantaleleq)$ is a complete lattice,
\item $(Q, \quantaleop)$ is a commutative monoid,
\item $\quantaleop$ commutes with arbitrary $\sup$s,
\item the largest element of $Q$ is neutral for $\quantaleop$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

For example, $([0,\infty], +, \geq)$ is a commutative integral quantale whose largest element is $0$ (notice the reversed ordering). It is straightforward to check that for all commutative integral quantales $Q,R$, the product monoid $Q \times R$ equipped with the product ordering is also a commutative integral quantale. In addition, for all posets $X$, the set of monotonically increasing (respectively, decreasing) functions from $X$ to $Q$, equipped with the pointwise monoid operation and the pointwise ordering, is also a commutative integral quantale. An other example of commutative integral quantale is given by the lattice of ideals of any commutative ring, with the product of ideals as the monoid operation.

\begin{definition} A \emph{generalised partial metric space} is the data of a set $X$, a commutative integral quantale $Q$ and a function $d : X \times X \to Q$ such that: \begin{itemize}
\item for all $x,y \in X$, $d(x,x) \quantalegeq d(x,y)$,
\item for all $x,y \in X$, if $d(x,x) = d(x,y) = d(y,y)$, then $x = y$,
\item for all $x,y \in X$, $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$,
\item for all $x,y,z \in X$, $d(x,z) \quantaleop d(y,y) \quantalegeq d(x,y) \quantaleop d(y,z)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

For all metric spaces $(X,d)$, $(X, ([0,\infty], +, \geq), d)$ is a generalised partial metric space: notice that the triangular inequality in this definition is the opposite of the usual one, which corresponds to the fact that the quantale ordering on $\mathbb{R}$ is the dual of the usual ordering. For a more telling and somewhat archetypal example, take any set $X$ and consider the set $X^{\leq \omega}$ of all sequences of elements of $X$ indexed by an ordinal less that or equal to $\omega$. For all such sequences $s,t$, let $d(s,t) = 2^{-n} \in [0,\infty]$, where $n$ is the length of the largest common prefix to $s$ and $t$: one can check that $(X^{\leq \omega}, [0,\infty], d)$ is indeed a generalised partial metric space -- in fact, if we interpret the prefixes of a sequence as pieces of partial information, then we have $d(s,s) = d(s,t)$ if and only if $t$ is a refinement of $s$ (\textit{i.e.} if it contains more information), and $d(s,s) = 0$ if and only if $s$ is total (\textit{i.e.} if it cannot be refined).

One can check that for all partial metric spaces $(X, Q, d_X)$ and $(Y, R, d_Y)$, $(X \times Y, Q \times R, d_{X \times Y})$ is a generalised partial metric space, where $d_{X \times Y}((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)) = (d_X(x_1, x_2), d_Y(y_1, y_2))$. However, in general, it is not clear how one should define a partial metric on a function space: Section \ref{subsection:type-gpms} will do this in a particular case.
