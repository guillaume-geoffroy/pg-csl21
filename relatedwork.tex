The first compositional formalization of approximate program transformations we are aware of is the one in \cite{chaudhuri}, where an explicit distinction is made between exact and approximate programs by 
associating, with each type $A$ of System F, a suitable type of approximated programs. While no
explicit mention of a  metric structure is made in that paper, it is not difficult to see that most examples presented in \cite{chaudhuri} can be suitably reformulated in our framework. 
%Moreover, the emphasis on typing rules for program distances 
%suggests to look for a similar   for our semantical language of approximate functions.

A more semantic framework is presented in recent work by Dal Lago, Gavazzo and Yoshimizu on \emph{differential logical relations} \cite{dallago:differential-stlc}. While following some ideas from \cite{chaudhuri}, \cite{dallago:differential-stlc} 
emphasize the need to define a metric space over simple types. To this end introduces, the idea of varying the quantales in which distances are measured is introduced as  a key ingredient to obtain a cartesian closed category. In such category all objects are endowed with the structure of a \emph{generalized metric domain}, obtained by a suitable weakening of usual metric axioms.

However, there seems to be no way of obtaining a standard metric structure based on differential logical relations. We can show this fact with a simple example. In such model the distance between two programs 
 $f,g:\mathsf{Real}\to \mathsf{Real}$ is taken in the quantale of functions from $\R\times \R_{+}^{\infty}$ to $\R_{+}^{\infty}$: intuitively, 
  $d(f,g)$ associates a closed interval $[x-\epsilon,x+\epsilon]$ (corresponding to the pair $(x,\varepsilon)$) with the smallest distance $\delta$ such that $[ f(x)-\delta, f(x)+\delta]$ and $[g(x)-\delta,g(x)+\delta]$ both contain the images of $[x-\varepsilon, x+\varepsilon]$ through
 $g$ and $f$ respectively (see Fig. \ref{fig:graph1}). 
%  The fact that $\diff (f)$ associates an interval $I=[x-\varepsilon, x+\varepsilon]$ with the smallest interval \emph{centered in $f(x)$} containing the image of $I$ forces an unwanted loss of precision. This can already be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:graph2}: 
%
As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:graph2}, by letting $\delta=d(g,g)(x,\varepsilon)$, we have that $d(g,g)$ sends the interval $I=[x-\varepsilon, x+\varepsilon]$ onto the interval $[g(x)-\delta, g(x)+\delta]$, which has diameter $2\delta$, while the image of $I$ has diameter $\delta$, making the triangular law of partial metrics fail.
